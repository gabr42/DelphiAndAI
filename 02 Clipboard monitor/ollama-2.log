Q> I want to create a Delphi application that would monitor clipboard content (on Windows) and append clipboard content to a log file each time the clipboard has changed (and has a text inside).

A> 
To create a Delphi application that monitors clipboard content and appends it to a log file, you can use the `TJvClipMonitor` component. This component is part of the JEDI VCL Library, which is a set of reusable components for Delphi.

Here's an example of how you can use this component to monitor the clipboard content:
```
uses
  Clipbrd, // Import the Clipboard unit
  JvClipMonitor; // Import the TJvClipMonitor component

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  // Create a new instance of the TJvClipMonitor component
  ClipMon := TJvClipMonitor.Create(Self);
  
  // Set up the clipboard monitoring options
  ClipMon.ClipboardFormat := cfText; // Only monitor text format
  ClipMon.OnChange := OnClipboardChange; // Call the OnClipboardChange event when the clipboard changes
end;

procedure TForm1.OnClipboardChange(Sender: TObject);
begin
  // Append the current clipboard content to a log file
  with TStringList.Create do
    try
      Add('Clipboard contents: ' + ClipMon.GetText);
      SaveToFile('clipboard_log.txt');
    finally
      Free;
    end;
end;
```
This code creates a new instance of the `TJvClipMonitor` component and sets up the clipboard monitoring options. When the clipboard changes, it calls the `OnClipboardChange` event handler, which appends the current clipboard content to a log file using a `TStringList` object.

Note that this code assumes that you have already created a form with a button called "Monitor Clipboard" that calls the `FormCreate` event when clicked. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs, such as adding more monitoring options or handling the clipboard content in different ways.

Q> Your code does not append the log file but overwrites it, please fix!

A> Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here's the corrected version of the code that appends the log file instead of overwriting it:
```
uses
  Clipbrd, // Import the Clipboard unit
  JvClipMonitor; // Import the TJvClipMonitor component

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  // Create a new instance of the TJvClipMonitor component
  ClipMon := TJvClipMonitor.Create(Self);
  
  // Set up the clipboard monitoring options
  ClipMon.ClipboardFormat := cfText; // Only monitor text format
  ClipMon.OnChange := OnClipboardChange; // Call the OnClipboardChange event when the clipboard changes
end;

procedure TForm1.OnClipboardChange(Sender: TObject);
begin
  // Append the current clipboard content to a log file
  with TStringList.Create do
    try
      Add('Clipboard contents: ' + ClipMon.GetText);
      SaveToFile('clipboard_log.txt', sfAppend); // Use the sfAppend parameter to append instead of overwrite
    finally
      Free;
    end;
end;
```
This code creates a new instance of the `TJvClipMonitor` component and sets up the clipboard monitoring options. When the clipboard changes, it calls the `OnClipboardChange` event handler, which appends the current clipboard content to a log file using a `TStringList` object. The `SaveToFile` method is called with the `sfAppend` parameter, which tells Delphi to append the new data to the existing log file instead of overwriting it.
