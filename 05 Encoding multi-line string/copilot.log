Q> I have a multiline string containing newline ASCII characters (TMemo.Text). I want to change it to a single-line string with only printable ASCII characters. I could do that with BASE64 encoding, for example. I would, however, like to keep the text as much readable as possible by "encoding" only non-printable characters. Is there a simple way to do that?

A> Yes, you can achieve this in Delphi by replacing non-printable characters with their corresponding escape sequences or other readable representations. Here's a simple way to do it:

1. Iterate through each character in the string.
2. Check if the character is printable.
3. If it's not printable, replace it with an escape sequence or a readable representation.

Here's a sample code snippet to help you get started:

```delphi
uses
  SysUtils;

function EncodeNonPrintableChars(const Input: string): string;
var
  i: Integer;
  ch: Char;
begin
  Result := '';
  for i := 1 to Length(Input) do
  begin
    ch := Input[i];
    if (Ord(ch) < 32) or (Ord(ch) > 126) then
      Result := Result + '#' + IntToStr(Ord(ch)) + ';'  // Replace non-printable characters
    else
      Result := Result + ch;  // Keep printable characters as is
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Memo1.Text := EncodeNonPrintableChars(Memo1.Text);
end;
```

In this example, non-printable characters are replaced with their ASCII codes in the format `#<code>;`. You can adjust the replacement format as needed to suit your readability requirements.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or have any other questions!

--------------------
Q> Can you check this code for any problems it may exhibit?

A> Sure, let's review the code for potential issues:

```delphi
uses
  SysUtils;

function EncodeNonPrintableChars(const Input: string): string;
var
  i: Integer;
  ch: Char;
begin
  Result := '';
  for i := 1 to Length(Input) do
  begin
    ch := Input[i];
    if (Ord(ch) < 32) or (Ord(ch) > 126) then
      Result := Result + '#' + IntToStr(Ord(ch)) + ';'  // Replace non-printable characters
    else
      Result := Result + ch;  // Keep printable characters as is
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Memo1.Text := EncodeNonPrintableChars(Memo1.Text);
end;
```

### Potential Issues and Improvements:

1. **Character Encoding**: The code assumes that the input string is in a single-byte character set (like ANSI). If the input string contains multi-byte characters (like UTF-8), the code might not handle them correctly. Consider using `TEncoding` to handle different encodings.

2. **Performance**: The code concatenates strings in a loop, which can be inefficient for large strings. Using a `TStringBuilder` can improve performance.

3. **Readability of Encoded Characters**: The format `#<code>;` might not be the most readable. You could consider using a different format or even a more descriptive representation.

Here's an improved version of the code:

```delphi
uses
  SysUtils, Classes;

function EncodeNonPrintableChars(const Input: string): string;
var
  i: Integer;
  ch: Char;
  sb: TStringBuilder;
begin
  sb := TStringBuilder.Create;
  try
    for i := 1 to Length(Input) do
    begin
      ch := Input[i];
      if (Ord(ch) < 32) or (Ord(ch) > 126) then
        sb.AppendFormat('#%d;', [Ord(ch)])  // Replace non-printable characters
      else
        sb.Append(ch);  // Keep printable characters as is
    end;
    Result := sb.ToString;
  finally
    sb.Free;
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Memo1.Text := EncodeNonPrintableChars(Memo1.Text);
end;
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Performance**: Using `TStringBuilder` for efficient string concatenation.
- **Readability**: The code is more readable and maintainable.

Q> What about the case when character '#' is present in the string to be encoded?

A> Good point! If the `#` character is present in the string, it could be confused with the encoded non-printable characters. To handle this, you can escape the `#` character itself. Here's an updated version of the code that handles this case:

```delphi
uses
  SysUtils, Classes;

function EncodeNonPrintableChars(const Input: string): string;
var
  i: Integer;
  ch: Char;
  sb: TStringBuilder;
begin
  sb := TStringBuilder.Create;
  try
    for i := 1 to Length(Input) do
    begin
      ch := Input[i];
      if ch = '#' then
        sb.Append('##')  // Escape the '#' character
      else if (Ord(ch) < 32) or (Ord(ch) > 126) then
        sb.AppendFormat('#%d;', [Ord(ch)])  // Replace non-printable characters
      else
        sb.Append(ch);  // Keep printable characters as is
    end;
    Result := sb.ToString;
  finally
    sb.Free;
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Memo1.Text := EncodeNonPrintableChars(Memo1.Text);
end;
```

In this version, the `#` character is escaped by replacing it with `##`. This way, you can distinguish between an actual `#` character and the start of an encoded non-printable character.

Q> Can you write me a decoding function for the last EncodeNonPrintableChars?

A> Sure! Here's a decoding function that reverses the encoding done by the `EncodeNonPrintableChars` function. This function will handle the `##` escape sequence for the `#` character and decode the `#<code>;` sequences back to their original characters:

```delphi
uses
  SysUtils, Classes;

function DecodeNonPrintableChars(const Input: string): string;
var
  i: Integer;
  sb: TStringBuilder;
  code: Integer;
  codeStr: string;
begin
  sb := TStringBuilder.Create;
  try
    i := 1;
    while i <= Length(Input) do
    begin
      if (Input[i] = '#') then
      begin
        if (i < Length(Input)) and (Input[i + 1] = '#') then
        begin
          sb.Append('#');  // Decode '##' to '#'
          Inc(i, 2);
        end
        else
        begin
          Inc(i);
          codeStr := '';
          while (i <= Length(Input)) and (Input[i] <> ';') do
          begin
            codeStr := codeStr + Input[i];
            Inc(i);
          end;
          if (i <= Length(Input)) and (Input[i] = ';') then
          begin
            if TryStrToInt(codeStr, code) then
              sb.Append(Char(code));
          end;
          Inc(i);
        end;
      end
      else
      begin
        sb.Append(Input[i]);
        Inc(i);
      end;
    end;
    Result := sb.ToString;
  finally
    sb.Free;
  end;
end;

procedure TForm1.Button2Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Memo1.Text := DecodeNonPrintableChars(Memo1.Text);
end;
```

### Explanation:
- The function iterates through each character in the input string.
- When it encounters a `#`, it checks if the next character is also `#` to handle the escape sequence for the `#` character.
- If it's not an escaped `#`, it reads the numeric code until it finds a `;` and converts it back to the original character.
- Printable characters are appended directly to the result.

You can call this function in a similar way as the encoding function to decode the text in your `TMemo`.
