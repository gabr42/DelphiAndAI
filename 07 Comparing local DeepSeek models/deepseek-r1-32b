Q> I have a multiline string containing newline ASCII characters (TMemo.Text). I want to change it to a single-line string with only printable ASCII characters. I could do that with BASE64 encoding, for example. I would, however, like to keep the text as much readable as possible by "encoding" only non-printable characters. Is there a simple way to do that?

A> To solve this problem, we need to convert a multiline string into a single-line string while ensuring readability by only encoding non-printable characters. The goal is to keep the text as readable as possible by leaving printable ASCII characters unchanged and encoding non-printable ones in a way that's easily understandable.

### Approach
1. **Identify Printable Characters**: We consider printable ASCII characters as those within the range from 32 (space) to 126.
2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the input string, check if it falls within the printable ASCII range.
3. **Encode Non-Printable Characters**: If a character is non-printable, convert it into its hexadecimal representation prefixed with `\x`. This ensures that the resulting string remains single-line and readable for those familiar with hex notation.
4. **Construct Result String**: Build the result string by appending each processed character (either unchanged or encoded).

### Solution Code
```delphi
function MakeSingleLine(const S: string): string;
var
  i: Integer;
  c: Char;
begin
  Result := '';
  for i := 1 to Length(S) do
  begin
    c := S[i];
    if (c >= #32) and (c <= #126) then
      Result += c
    else
      Result += Format('\x%0.2x', [Ord(c)]);
  end;
end;
```

### Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The function `MakeSingleLine` takes a string `S` as input and returns the processed single-line string.
- **Loop Through Characters**: Using a loop, each character in the input string is examined.
- **Check Printability**: Each character is checked to see if it lies within the printable ASCII range. If it does, it's added directly to the result string.
- **Encode Non-Printables**: For non-printable characters, their ASCII value is converted into a two-digit hexadecimal string prefixed with `\x`. This ensures that all non-printable characters are represented in a readable and consistent format without causing line breaks.

This approach efficiently handles both printable and non-printable characters, ensuring the resulting string is single-line while maintaining readability for those familiar with hex notation.

R> Okay, so I have this problem where I need to convert a multiline string into a single-line string but still make it somewhat readable. The user mentioned using Base64 encoding, but they want something simpler where only the non-printable characters are encoded, leaving the rest as is.

Hmm, first, I should understand what's considered printable ASCII. From what I know, printable ASCII characters range from 32 (space) to 126. So any character below 32 or above 126 is non-printable and needs to be handled.

The user wants to replace these non-printable characters with something readable. Maybe using escape sequences like \n for newlines, \t for tabs, etc., but I'm not sure if that's exactly what they want. Alternatively, encoding them into hexadecimal or some other format could work.

Wait, the user suggested Base64 as an example, but they don't want to go that route. So perhaps a custom approach where each non-printable character is represented in a way that's still readable when it's not printable. For instance, replacing line breaks with their escape sequences or using some kind of encoding like hex.

Let me think about the steps involved:

1. Iterate through each character in the input string.
2. For each character, check if it's within the printable ASCII range (32 to 126).
3. If it is printable, keep it as is.
4. If it's not, replace it with an encoded version. The user wants this encoded part to still be somewhat readable, so maybe using hexadecimal or a specific escape sequence.

Now, how do I represent non-printable characters in a readable way? Using hex might work because each byte can be represented by two hex digits, which is concise and still readable for those who know what they're looking at. For example, newline (ASCII 10) would become \x0A or something like that.

Alternatively, using escape sequences like \n, \t, etc., could make it more readable for people familiar with such notations, but this might only cover a few specific characters and not all non-printables.

So perhaps the approach is to:

- For each character in the input:
  - If it's printable (32 <= ord(c) <= 126), leave it as is.
  - Else, replace it with its hexadecimal representation prefixed by something like \x. So for example, a newline would become \x0A.

But wait, how about control characters or other non-printables? Using hex seems to cover all possibilities and keeps the string single-line because each character is represented by multiple printable characters but doesn't include newlines themselves.

Another consideration: The resulting string must be single-line. So any newline or carriage return in the original string needs to be encoded so they don't cause line breaks. That's why using \xHH makes sense because it represents those control characters without adding actual newlines.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Delphi. I'll need a function that takes a string and processes each character accordingly.

Let me outline the steps for the code:

- Create a function called MakeSingleLine that takes a string as input.
- Initialize an empty result string.
- Loop through each character in the input:
  - Get the ASCII value of the current character.
  - If it's between 32 and 126, add it to the result.
  - Else, format its hexadecimal representation with two digits and prepend a \x. Add this to the result.
- Return the processed string.

Wait, but what about characters above 127? In Delphi, strings can have Unicode characters, so I need to handle those as well. But since the user specified printable ASCII, perhaps we're only considering up to 126 and beyond that is non-printable. Or maybe they want to treat any character beyond 127 as non-printable too.

I think in this case, focusing on the standard printable ASCII range (32-126) makes sense. So any character outside of that needs encoding.

Testing this approach: For example, if the input is "Hello\nWorld", the \n would be converted to \x0A, resulting in "Hello\x0AWorld". This keeps it single-line and readable as much as possible.

Another test case: If there's a tab character (ASCII 9), it becomes \x09. Someone reading this string can understand that it represents a tab.

But what about characters like space or letters? They remain unchanged, so the output is as readable as possible except for non-printables.

I should also consider how to handle Unicode characters beyond ASCII. If the input has them, they might not be printable in the traditional sense, but perhaps the user wants to keep those as well if they are printable in a broader sense. But since the question mentions ASCII, maybe it's safe to assume that any character outside 32-126 is non-printable and needs encoding.

Potential issues:

- The resulting string might have \x sequences which could be mistaken for literal backslashes and x's. But if the user is aware of this encoding method, they can decode it accordingly.
- Performance: For very long strings, processing each character in a loop could be slow. However, given that the user is using TMemo.Text, which typically isn't excessively long, it should be manageable.

So putting it all together, I'll write a Delphi function that loops through each character, checks if it's printable ASCII, and encodes non-printables into \xHH format.
