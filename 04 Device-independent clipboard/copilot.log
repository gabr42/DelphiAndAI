To copy text to the clipboard in a Delphi Firemonkey application, you can use the IFMXClipboardService interface. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:

procedure TFormMain.ButtonCopyClick(Sender: TObject);
var
  ClipboardService: IFMXClipboardService;
begin
  if TPlatformServices.Current.SupportsPlatformService(IFMXClipboardService) then
  begin
    ClipboardService := IFMXClipboardService(TPlatformServices.Current.GetPlatformService(IFMXClipboardService));
    ClipboardService.SetClipboard(Memo1.Text); // Replace Memo1.Text with the text you want to copy
  end;
end;
In this example:

Check if the platform supports the clipboard service using SupportsPlatformService.
Get the clipboard service using GetPlatformService.
Set the clipboard content using SetClipboard[1][2].
This code snippet assumes you have a TButton named ButtonCopy and a TMemo named Memo1 on your form. When the button is clicked, the text from Memo1 is copied to the clipboard.
